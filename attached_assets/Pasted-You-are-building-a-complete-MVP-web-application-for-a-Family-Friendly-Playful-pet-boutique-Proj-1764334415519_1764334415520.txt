Design Requirements (Family-Friendly, Playful):
- Use TailwindCSS with a bright, friendly look:
   - Light background (white or very light pastel)
   - Primary colors: soft blue, coral, yellow, mint-style accents
   - Rounded corners, soft shadows, and card-based layout.
- Hero should feel welcoming and fun:
   - Use pet imagery (dogs/cats) and subtle paw/shape patterns if possible.
- Use mid-sized, rounded typography (e.g., headings with a friendly font, body text with a clean sans-serif).
- All pages must be fully responsive (mobile-first).
- Buttons should be full-width on mobile with clear CTAs and optional emojis (e.g. "Book a Visit 🐾").
- Maintain good contrast and readability even with playful colors.

AI Integration:
- Use Replit AI SDK to create a function that takes user answers from PuppyMatch and builds a prompt such as:

  "You are an assistant helping match dog breeds to Indian urban pet owners in Hyderabad. The user is using a family-friendly pet shop website called Vahis Pet World in Jubilee Hills. Based on this profile:
  - Budget: [budget_answer]
  - Housing: [housing_answer]
  - Exercise time: [exercise_answer]
  - Temperament preference: [temperament_answer]
  - Kids in family: [kids_answer]
  - Experience level: [experience_answer]

  Recommend 1–3 suitable dog breeds that are reasonably available in Indian markets. For each breed, provide:
  - breedName
  - shortDescription (1–2 sentences, friendly tone)
  - whyItMatches (2–3 bullet points)
  - estimatedMonthlyCostINR (e.g. '₹4,000–₹7,000')

  Return the response as valid JSON only, with this structure:

  {
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "breedName": "",
        "shortDescription": "",
        "whyItMatches": ["", ""],
        "estimatedMonthlyCostINR": ""
      }
    ]
  }"

- The backend should parse this JSON and send it to the frontend to render the results.

File Structure:
- `app.js` (Express server entry point)
- `routes/` folder for main route handlers (`home.js`, `puppyMatch.js`, `pets.js`, `store.js`, `grooming.js`, `admin.js`, etc.)
- `public/` for static assets (images, client-side JS, CSS if needed)
- `views/` if using a template engine, or static HTML templates
- `data/pets.json`, `data/products.json`, `data/bookings.json` for MVP data storage

Add a final README-style console output or comment explaining:
- How to run the app (e.g. `npm install` then `node app.js` or `npm start`)
- How to change pets and products via JSON or through the admin panel
- How to change the color scheme and basic UI using Tailwind utility classes
- Where the PuppyMatch AI integration code lives and how to tweak the prompt

Make sure:
- The app runs with `node app.js` or `npm start`.
- All main routes are wired correctly in `app.js`.
- Forms do not crash the server if fields are missing (basic validation).
- There are no TypeScript or complex build steps; keep it simple JavaScript for this MVP.
